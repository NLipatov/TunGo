# Transport Selection

:::danger[Protocol Must Be Identical on Client and Server]
Both client and server *MUST* use the same protocol.

For example, both client and server may use TCP or UDP as transport.
:::

## Configure transport on server

See the `EnableTCP` and `EnableUDP` keys in the server configuration file (`src/settings/server/conf.json`).

The server has a section for each protocol it supports:
```json
{
  ...,
  "EnableTCP": false, // <-- TCP turned off
  "EnableUDP": true // <-- UDP turned on
}
```

## Configure transport on client

:::tip[Client configuration]
The recommended way to configure the client is to generate the client configuration from the server.

The server will automatically set all client configuration values.
:::

The client-side configuration (`src/settings/client/conf.json`) contains a `Protocol` key, which can have 2 possible values â€” "udp" or "tcp":
```json
{
  ...,
  "Protocol": "udp"
}
```

or

```json
{
  ...,
  "Protocol": "tcp"
}
```
